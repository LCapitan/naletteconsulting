            <h1>My Emmy,</h1>
            <p>I had so much fun with you.</p>
            <p>
              Honestly, no girl has ever made me laugh so hard, so much. We got
              along so well and so quickly because we&#39;re the same in so many
              - almost too many - ways. We both know God brought us together
              when He did for a reason, and I thought it was for us to be
              together. He showed me after I moved, that maybe that wasn&#39;t
              the reason..which is why I&#39;d mentioned a few times that it
              seemed like you just needed someone to be there for you so maybe
              we shouldn&#39;t be dating and just be friends. I should&#39;ve
              told you that I felt God was telling me that, I should&#39;ve said
              let&#39;s pray about it. Instead I just let things go on and
              ignored God. Which is why we ended up the way we did. We both hurt
              each other, sure, but I deliberately disobeyed God - multiple
              times - and if I hadn&#39;t none of this would have happened. I
              was supposed to protect you and your heart...and I didn&#39;t.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don&#39;t for a second think that I regret dating you. I
              don&#39;t. It may have ended horribly, but being with you is the
              best thing that has ever happened to me and ever will happen.
              Being able to hug you, touch you, hold you, make you laugh and
              smile, will forever be my most cherished memories.
            </p>
            <p>
              I broke down so badly yesterday because I&#39;m realizing my own
              bad patterns. I&#39;m realizing how many times you were right
              about me, and how many times I shrugged you off. How I head into
              darkness whenever I don&#39;t want to do something God is telling
              me to. I&#39;m realizing that, yeah we perceive things
              differently, but that&#39;s because I only view things from my
              perspective. We both could have been better, but as a man I should
              have done what was right for us and I didn&#39;t and it snowballed
              into a disastrous chapter for both of our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              You&#39;ve said I need to give things to God, and I have been. You
              said I have to want to get better and I do. Every time I give
              things to God, it&#39;s like he reveals a memory that I&#39;d
              forgotten where I handled things the wrong way, or where you told
              me something and I ignored it. And it sucks. In therapy it&#39;s
              been a nightmare to face myself and learn all these things,
              especially when so many of the things were things you told me
              about myself and I completely dismissed your opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am really sorry that I&#39;ve been dragging you through such a
              miserable break up too. You did what you needed to be happy and I
              made you feel bad because it meant not being with me and I
              couldn&#39;t understand how destructive and mean I was/have been.
              Everyday for more than a year I&#39;ve just been planning this
              future with you that&#39;s evaporated and the real problem is that
              I wasn&#39;t present enough to do what had to be done and be who I
              needed to be for you to make that future possible. For that I
              truly apologize.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to let you go, I promise. I&#39;m just seeing things a
              lot more clearly now and I hate knowing how badly I&#39;ve hurt
              you and made you feel, so I&#39;m trying to give you the
              validation and reassurance that you deserved then so you can move
              on knowing you&#39;re not the things I&#39;ve accused you of
              being.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did expect too much from you. I didn&#39;t just expect love and
              respect, I expected you to do what I thought you needed to do to
              feel better and grow. My intentions were good, everyone should
              want their bf/gf to grow and they should challenge them but I went
              about it so poorly, which you were right about too. You were
              showing me things and challenging me too and I was just so…stupid,
              stubborn, and stagnant. Unreceptive. Prideful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&#39;ve never wanted a submissive girl. Ever….I did see a lot of
              things that I wanted you to see so that you&#39;d be happy,
              we&#39;d be happy, and I&#39;d be happy, I just was an asshole
              about it and yeah you were right, I did kind of just want you to
              submit and do things. That was wrong of me. You were right about
              my acts of love being transactional. I was just going through the
              motions, and then expected you to do what I wanted you to. And so
              many other things. I should have listened to you and I wish I did.
            </p>
            <p>
              You didn&#39;t make me go crazy, I&#39;ve just spent so much time
              in denial and have avoided my own growth and rejected the help
              you&#39;d consistently and so lovingly offer me and desperately
              encouraged and I am painfully, and regretfully sorry that I
              wouldn&#39;t listen to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know I have a tough road ahead because God is just going to show
              me more. I won&#39;t keep reaching out to you but, know you are
              not who I made you out to be and. We both sort of became what we
              feared most about each other. Be it trauma, baggage, ptsd, etc, we
              should have been better and I should have led that and I&#39;m
              sorry. This morning was the first time in a long time that I
              actually felt like Austin again. I spent all day and night begging
              God to make whatever I was feeling stop, and He actually did…I
              regret so much, and need to learn to love myself better and
              finally forgive myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              You were and are an amazing person. You&#39;re wise, you&#39;re
              intuitive, you&#39;re observant, you&#39;re caring, you&#39;re
              loyal, you&#39;re funny, you&#39;re creative, you&#39;re talented,
              you&#39;re so smart, you&#39;re so capable, you&#39;re passionate,
              you&#39;re kind and sweet, you love so deeply and intentionally,
              you see the best in people (even though you always got some tea on
              everyone), you&#39;re accepting, you&#39;re one of the strongest
              women I&#39;ve ever met, you&#39;re brave, you&#39;re helpful,
              you&#39;re compassionate, you&#39;re thoughtful, you&#39;re
              diligent, you can cook sheeeeeesh, you can sing, you&#39;re so
              calming and warm, you&#39;re nurturing, you&#39;re trusting,
              you&#39;re supportive and encouraging, you&#39;re considerate,
              you&#39;re wildly forgiving and graceful, you&#39;re smooth aslll,
              you&#39;re ambitious, you&#39;re thoughtful, you&#39;re loved, and
              you are worthy and deserving of the world, Emily. I wish I could
              have given it to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&#39;m sorry I won&#39;t be around to watch you thrive and
              dominate the XD world, but I&#39;m so, so proud of you. You&#39;re
              going to do amazing things in this lifetime and I have no doubt
              that everyone you meet from here on out will look up to you and
              want to be like you. Your life is going to be much better without
              me, and I&#39;m really excited to hear about everything you
              accomplish in your life if we ever run into each other again.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yeah, this has felt like a bad dream, but it&#39;s because of
              me. But I am finally waking up..
            </p>
            <p>
              As Micah&#39;s bitch of a mistress once said, I&#39;m not sure how
              to land this plane, but I hope you grow and learn to love yourself
              and see you the way that I see you so you don&#39;t get stuck with
              someone like me again. I hope you have an amazing life, a loving
              and nurturing husband, a beautiful family, and I hope God reveals
              your purpose to you soon and continues to fill your heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the bottom of my broken heart, I&#39;m sorry about that wedge
              and I miss you so much..
            </p>
            <p className={styles.sign}>I will never stop loving you,</p>
            <p>Austeoporosis</p>
            <p className={styles.sign}>
              ps: I&#39;m still down for the 32 & single deal we made if you
              are. I&#39;ll have the farm, the chickens, goats, buns, and
              Mantequilla, plus the wedding venue business ready for you..
